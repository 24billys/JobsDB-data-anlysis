# Data Visualization with Power BI

Data visualization is a crucial aspect of any data analysis project, as it enables me to effectively communicate insights and trends to stakeholders. 
For this project, I utilized Power BI, a powerful business intelligence tool, to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards that showcase my
analysis of the data professional job market. Below are some key aspects of my data visualization process

## Dashboard Design
I carefully designed the layout and structure of my Power BI dashboards to ensure a user-friendly and intuitive experience. 
I organized the visualizations in a logical manner, allowing stakeholders to easily navigate and explore the insights I uncovered.

I dividended into three parts, Gneral, Qualification and Career Level, Job Responsibility and Requirement
