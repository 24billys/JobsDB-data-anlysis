This dataset provides valuable insights into the job market by capturing job postings from JobsDB.com,
a prominent job search engine catering to both job seekers and employers.

The main objective of this project is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the data professional job landscape on JobsDB.com.
By analyzing this dataset, I aim to uncover different data professional job, identify key skills and qualifications, also the working experience sought by employers,
and gain insights into the demand and characteristics of data professional roles.

for this analysis, however JobsDB.com allow employer not providing the salary range and the result it is not enough data for me to analysis any reliable finding through this information.

To ensure the dataset is clean and ready for analysis, extensive data wrangling was performed. Leveraging the power of Excel, I conducted data cleaning, filtering, and transformation tasks. This involved handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and extracting relevant information from the provided dataset. For more detail please go to the Data Wrangling file ...

However during the analysis process, I discover that this dataset got some limitation for me to have a reliable analysis, that's included:
- The dataset only include one month data in JobsDB.com and this may not reflect the whole picture of data professional in Hong Kong
- JobsDB.com allow employer not providing the salary range, and salary is one of the most important key information in this dataset. More than half of the employer not providing the salary information

## Conclusion

By understanding the trends and requirements of the industry, individuals can better position themselves for career growth, while organizations can gain insights to refine their hiring strategies.
